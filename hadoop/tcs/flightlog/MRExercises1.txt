Sample data set for analysis is the flight details logs (divided into different  files for each year) whose each record is defined by the following details:

Sl.No	Name	Description
1	Year	1987-2008
2	Month	1-12
3	DayofMonth	1-31
4	DayOfWeek	1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday)
5	DepTime	actual departure time (local, hhmm)
6	CRSDepTime	scheduled departure time (local, hhmm)
7	ArrTime	actual arrival time (local, hhmm)
8	CRSArrTime	scheduled arrival time (local, hhmm)
9	UniqueCarrier	unique carrier code
10	FlightNum	flight number
11	TailNum	plane tail number
12	ActualElapsedTime	in minutes
13	CRSElapsedTime	in minutes
14	AirTime	in minutes
15	ArrDelay	arrival delay, in minutes
16	DepDelay	departure delay, in minutes
17	Origin	origin IATA airport code
18	Dest	destination IATA airport code
19	Distance	in miles
20	TaxiIn	taxi in time, in minutes
21	TaxiOut	taxi out time in minutes
22	Cancelled	was the flight cancelled?
23	CancellationCode	reason for cancellation (A = carrier, B = weather, C = NAS, D = security)
24	Diverted	1 = yes, 0 = no
25	CarrierDelay	in minutes
26	WeatherDelay	in minutes
27	NASDelay	in minutes
28	SecurityDelay	in minutes
29	LateAircraftDelay	in minutes

Exercises based on above data:
-----------------------------------

1. Comparison:
Develop a mapreduce program which will find the greatest distance travelled in miles (Distance) by a carrier during a single flight in each year(Year).
Desired output: Year, Greatest Single flight distance by a carrier

2. Aggregation:
Develop a mapreduce program which will find the total distance travelled in miles (Distance) by each carrier (UniqueCarrier) for all years combined. 
Desired output:   UniqueCarrier,Total distance  for all years 

3. Grouping:
Develop a mapreduce program which will find the total distance travelled in miles (Distance) by each carrier (UniqueCarrier) FOR EACH YEAR (Year) separately.  Obtain the UniqueCarrier number as user input so that user can filter the output content. If carrier number is not provided, display output for all carriers.
Desired output:   Year,UniqueCarrier,Total distance for that year

Extras:
--------
Try to output the files as :
	Normal text file
	Compressed file with Bzip2 ,Gzip,lzo,snappy.

Due to small size of data only a single mapper will be spawned, try to tweak the code to spawn multiple mappers by adjusting the blocksize and hence the splitsize.

Try using combiner classes wherever appilcable.
